/// <summary>
/// An Opinion represents a personal judgment or belief, which is not necessarily
/// rooted in fact or knowledge. It is subjective in nature and can vary significantly
/// from person to person. Opinions often express personal preferences or perspectives.
/// For example, a statement like "I think vanilla ice cream is the best flavor" is an opinion.
/// 
/// Since opinions are based on personal perspectives, they cannot be strictly proven or disproven.
/// For instance, a statement such as "I believe cats are better pets than dogs" cannot be conclusively
/// validated or invalidated - it is contingent on individual preferences.
///
/// Although opinions can foster discussions and allow for a diverse range of viewpoints, they are less
/// likely to form the basis of a logical argument due to their subjective nature. Unlike assertions,
/// which are objective statements of fact, opinions are more personal interpretations or sentiments,
/// and they may or may not have a large impact due to their relative importance level.
